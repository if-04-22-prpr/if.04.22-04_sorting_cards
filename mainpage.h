* @section intro Introduction
*
* The implementation of a sorting algorithm of your choice.
* 
* @section objective Assignment Objective
* In this assignment the characters of a string shall be sorted using a sorting algorithm
* of the authors choice except Bubble Sort.
* 
* **Configuration**
*
* There is no configuration required.
*
* @section assignment Assignment
* The sorting algorithm shall be implemented in file 'sorting_main_driver.c' along with explanary functions. 
*
* -# Implement required function in 'sorting_main_driver.c'
*
* @section notes Notes
* -# make cleantest: This new make target for clearing the console, building, and running unit test is available.
* -# Sometimes changes are not properly detected by incremental builds. If something very strange 
*    happens during compilation, try to run `make clean` followed by `make` to start a clean build.
*    This approach is also recommended after everthing is done, because some compiler warning appears
*    only in clean builds.
